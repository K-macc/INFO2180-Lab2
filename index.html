                <h2>Coral Reefs</h2>
                <h4>October 2, 2023 by Keshawn</h4>
                <p><img src="coral.jpeg" alt="Coral Reefs" style="float:right;width:144px;height:144px;">A coral reef is
                    an
                    underwater ecosystem characterized by reef-building corals. Reefs are formed of
                    colonies of coral polyps held together by calcium carbonate.[1] Most coral reefs are built from
                    stony corals, whose polyps cluster in groups. Coral belongs to the class Anthozoa in the animal
                    phylum Cnidaria, which includes sea anemones and
                    jellyfish. Unlike sea anemones, corals secrete hard carbonate exoskeletons that support and protect
                    the coral. Most reefs grow best in warm, shallow, clear, sunny and agitated water. Coral reefs first
                    appeared 485 million years ago, at the dawn of the Early Ordovician, displacing the microbial and
                    sponge reefs of the Cambrian.[2]

                    Sometimes called rainforests of the sea,[3] shallow coral reefs form some of Earth's most diverse
                    ecosystems. They occupy less than 0.1% of the world's ocean area, about half the area of France, yet
                    they provide a home for at least 25% of all marine species,[4][5][6][7] including fish, mollusks,
                    worms, crustaceans, echinoderms, sponges, tunicates and other cnidarians.[8] Coral reefs flourish in
                    ocean waters that provide few nutrients. They are most commonly found at shallow depths in tropical
                    waters, but deep water and cold water coral reefs exist on smaller scales in other areas.</p>

                <h2>Pollution</h2>
                <h4>October 2, 2023 by Keshawn</h4>
                <p><img src="pollution.jpeg" alt="Pollution" style="float:left;width:144px;height:144px;">Pollution is
                    the
                    introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful materials are
                    called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They can also be created by
                    human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories. Pollutants damage the quality of air,
                    water, and land.

                    Many things that are useful to people produce pollution. Cars spew pollutants from their exhaust
                    pipes. Burning coal to create electricity pollutes the air. Industries and homes generate garbage
                    and sewage that can pollute the land and water. Pesticides—chemical poisons used to kill weeds and
                    insects—seep into waterways and harm wildlife.</p>
